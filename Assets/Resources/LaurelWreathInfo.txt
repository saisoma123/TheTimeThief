The Olympic Games are a completion of athletes from around the world competing for Gold medals in various sporting events. In modern times it occurs twice every 4 years, once for the Summer Games and once for the Winter Games. Different cities around the world have hosted the Olympics over the years, but the origin lies in the country of Greece. It was originally a tournament of Greek Athletes, hosted in Olympia, Greece in order to honor the King of the Gods Zeus. It didnâ€™t become a global competition until it was later resurrected in 1896, hosted in Athens, Greece. This Laurel Wreath was the original prize for winners of the ancient games before gold medals were ever adopted.
