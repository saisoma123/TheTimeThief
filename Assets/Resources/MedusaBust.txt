Greek Mythology was an important part of all aspects of the lives of the Greek people as it was their primary religion. Greek Mythology centers around the main pantheon of gods Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, Demeter, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Athena, Hephaestus, Dionysus and Aphrodite, by praying to them daily as well as burning offerings, building monuments and holding celebrations for them. These myths were stories passed down through word, song and literature that taught lessons and gave warnings using stories of mythical beings and fantastical events. This Medusa Bust depicts one of these stories which was a story about the hero Perseus slaying the Gorgon Medusa whose gaze would turn whoever met it to stone, using a polished shield to avoid her gaze.
