Ancient Greek painted vases were more than just potteryâ€”they told stories about Greek life, culture, and beliefs. These vases often showed scenes from mythology, daily activities, or famous figures. During this time, Greek philosophers also explored big questions about life and the world. One of the most famous philosophers, Socrates, became known for his unique method of asking questions to challenge ideas and help people think more deeply. His teachings inspired many others, including his student Plato.
